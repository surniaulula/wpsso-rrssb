= Proven Performance =

WPSSO and WPSSO RRSSB are *fast and coded for performance*, making full use of all available caching techniques (persistent / non-persistent object and disk caching). WPSSO loads only the library files and object classes it needs, keeping it small, fast, and yet still able to support a wide range of 3rd party integration features.

= Extends the WPSSO Plugin =

The WordPress Social Sharing Optimization (WPSSO) plugin is required to use the WPSSO RRSSB extension.
